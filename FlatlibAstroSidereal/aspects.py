    This module provides useful for handling aspects between 
    objects in flatlib. An aspect is an angular relation 
    between a planet and another object.
  
    This module has the following base terminology:
    - Active/Passive object: The active object is the planet 
      responsible for the aspect.
    - Separation: the angular distance between the active and 
      passive object.
    - Orb: the orb distance (>0) between active and passive 
      objects.
    - Obj.orb: is the orb allowed by the aspect.
    - Type: the type of the aspect.
    - Direction/Condition/Movement/etc. are properties of an 
      aspect.
    - Movement: The objects have their movements, but the 
      aspect movement can be also exact.
  
    Major aspects must be within orb of one of the planets.
    Minor aspects only when within a max allowed orb.
  
    In parameters, objA is the active object and objP is the 
    passive object.
