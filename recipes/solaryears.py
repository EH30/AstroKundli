    A tropical solar year is the length from spring equinox
    to the following spring equinox. 
    
    This recipe was implemented to reply to a topic opened
    at http://skyscript.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8563
    and shows that the solar year has an amplitude of more
    than 25 minutes, considering the average year of 365.2425
    days. 
    
    To plot the graphics you must have matplotlib installed.
