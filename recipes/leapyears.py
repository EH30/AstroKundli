    Solar return date and time jumps forward and backwards 
    every year. This is related with the average number of
    days in a year (365.25). However, in certain conditions,
    the time distance is greater than 24h and increases with
    the years.
    
    This recipe was implemented to reply to a topic opened
    at http://skyscript.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8563
    
    Set the birth date and time and 'span' as the number of 
    years to see what happens with the hourly distances.
    
    To plot the graphics you must have matplotlib installed.
